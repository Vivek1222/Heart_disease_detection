## Project Description

This Heart Disease Prediction project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients, providing valuable insights for preventive healthcare. Through predictive analysis, the project aims to help healthcare providers and patients make informed decisions by identifying risk factors associated with heart disease. This predictive tool can aid in early diagnosis and potentially reduce the impact of heart disease on individuals and healthcare systems.

## Project Objective

The primary objective is to build a robust predictive model to classify individuals as high or low risk for heart disease, which can be used for:

### Risk Assessment: Identifying patients at higher risk, enabling timely intervention.

### Preventive Healthcare: Assisting healthcare providers in focusing resources on high-risk individuals.

### Data-Driven Recommendations: Informing patients about lifestyle changes or treatments to reduce risk.

### Dataset

The project used a publicly available heart disease dataset, featuring:

### Clinical Data: Includes features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

### Target Label: Each entry is labeled to indicate the presence or absence of heart disease.

### Methodology

Implemented in Python, this project utilized several machine learning libraries and followed these steps:

### Data Preprocessing:


Handled missing values, standardized features, and selected key attributes.
Applied feature engineering techniques to enhance model relevance.
Feature Selection:

Applied statistical tests to identify the most influential features, reducing dimensionality and improving accuracy.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Tested multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, selecting the best-performing model based on these metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Conducted Grid Search for optimizing model parameters, achieving an accuracy of over 85%.
Key Findings

Risk Assessment: The model successfully categorizes patients into risk levels, aiding in early intervention.
Data-Driven Insights: Identified which clinical factors most significantly contribute to heart disease risk.
Preventive Potential: Demonstrated the potential of predictive analytics in healthcare.
